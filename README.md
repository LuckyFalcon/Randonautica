# Randonautica

This was a version of Randonautica that was in the making in 2020 when the app went viral.

During this time myself and a few others worked on this application.

We got 10 million downloads in a few months and the original app was still a work in progress so we needed something new.

Back then we decided to use Flutter as it was compatible with both Android and IOS so we would have one app we could update for both platforms at the same time.

If you wish to compile this version I would suggest looking at the branch on Aug 17, 2020 or earlier, because we had to make some drastic changes from that point.

Enjoy.
